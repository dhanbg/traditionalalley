# Quick Email Authentication Setup

## 🚀 Immediate Actions to Improve Email Deliverability

### Step 1: Check Your Current Status
```bash
# First, update the domain in check-email-deliverability.js
# Then run:
node check-email-deliverability.js
```

### Step 2: Add DNS Records

#### SPF Record (TXT)
**Host/Name:** `@` or your domain name  
**Value:** `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`

*If using different email provider:*
- **Gmail/Google Workspace:** `include:_spf.google.com`
- **Outlook/Office 365:** `include:spf.protection.outlook.com`
- **SendGrid:** `include:sendgrid.net`
- **Mailgun:** `include:mailgun.org`

#### DMARC Record (TXT)
**Host/Name:** `_dmarc`  
**Value:** `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com`

#### DKIM Record
*This depends on your email provider. Enable DKIM in your email service first, then they'll provide the DNS record.*

### Step 3: Content Optimization

#### ✅ Good Email Practices
