## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Since all backend components are working correctly, the issue is likely in the **frontend implementation** or **data flow**. Common causes:

1. **Missing Customer Email**: The order data might not contain a valid customer email
2. **JavaScript Errors**: Frontend errors preventing the API call
3. **Data Validation Issues**: Invalid or missing data in the order object
4. **Silent Failures**: Errors being caught but not properly displayed

## 🧪 Testing Tools Created

### 1. Direct Email Test
```bash
node test-email-sending.js
```
- Tests SMTP connection
- Sends a real email with PDF attachment
- Validates email configuration

### 2. API Endpoint Test
```bash
node test-invoice-api.js
```
- Tests the `/api/send-invoice-email` endpoint
- Simulates the exact API call from frontend
- Validates request/response flow

### 3. Debugging Tool
```bash
node debug-invoice-flow.js
```
- Provides debugging instructions
- Validates order data structure
- Simulates email sending process

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open your application in browser
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Generate an invoice
5. Look for any error messages

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Generate an invoice
3. Look for a request to `/api/send-invoice-email`
4. Check if the request:
   - ✅ Is being made
   - ✅ Returns status 200
   - ✅ Contains proper data

### Step 3: Check Server Console
1. Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
2. Generate an invoice
3. Look for messages like:
   - `"Sending invoice email to: [email]"`
   - `"Invoice email sent successfully"`
   - Any error messages

### Step 4: Verify Customer Data
Add this debug code to `OrderManagement.jsx` around line 865:

```javascript
// Add this before the email sending code
console.log('🔍 Order Data Debug:', {
  orderData,
  receiverDetails: orderData.receiver_details,
  customerEmail: orderData.receiver_details?.email,
  hasEmail: !!orderData.receiver_details?.email
});
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing Customer Email
**Symptoms**: Console shows "No customer email found"
**Solution**: Ensure customer provides email during checkout

### Issue 2: Invalid Email Format
**Symptoms**: Email validation fails
**Solution**: Validate email format in frontend forms

### Issue 3: JavaScript Errors
**Symptoms**: API call never happens
**Solution**: Fix JavaScript errors shown in console

### Issue 4: Silent API Failures
**Symptoms**: API call happens but fails silently
**Solution**: Check server console for detailed error messages
