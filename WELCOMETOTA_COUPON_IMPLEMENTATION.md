# WELCOMETOTA Coupon Auto-Selection Implementation

This document describes the implementation of automatic coupon selection for the "WELCOMETOTA" coupon code.

## Overview

The system automatically checks if a logged-in user has previously used the "WELCOMETOTA" coupon and auto-applies it during checkout if they haven't used it before.

## Features

1. **Automatic Detection**: Checks if user has used WELCOMETOTA coupon from Strapi backend
2. **Auto-Application**: Automatically applies the coupon during checkout if eligible
3. **User Control**: Users can remove the auto-applied coupon if they prefer to use a different one
4. **Visual Distinction**: Auto-applied coupons have different styling to indicate they were automatically selected

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

1. **`utils/productVariantUtils.js`** - Added utility functions:
   - `checkWelcomeCouponUsage(userId)` - Checks if user has used the coupon
   - `getWelcomeCouponForAutoSelection(userId)` - Returns coupon data for auto-selection
   - `isValidCoupon(coupon)` - Helper to validate coupon status and dates

2. **`components/otherPages/Checkout.jsx`** - Modified checkout component:
   - Added auto-selection logic in useEffect hook
   - Enhanced coupon display with auto-selection messaging
   - Integrated with existing coupon validation system

3. **`app/test-welcome-coupon/page.jsx`** - Created test page to demonstrate functionality

### API Integration

The implementation uses the existing Strapi API endpoint:
```
GET /api/coupons?populate=*
```

The system looks for:
- Coupon with code "WELCOMETOTA"
- `usedByUserData` array to check if user has used it
- Coupon validity (active status and date range)

### User Experience

#### For New Users (Haven't used WELCOMETOTA)
1. User goes to checkout page
2. System automatically applies WELCOMETOTA coupon
3. Special blue message appears: "ðŸŽ‰ Welcome discount automatically applied!"
4. User can remove it and apply a different coupon if desired

#### For Existing Users (Already used WELCOMETOTA)
1. User goes to checkout page
2. Normal coupon interface is shown
3. No auto-selection occurs

## Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/test-welcome-coupon` to:
- Check coupon usage status for any user
- See auto-selection eligibility
- Understand how the system works

### Manual Testing
1. Log in with a user who hasn't used WELCOMETOTA
2. Add items to cart and go to checkout
3. Verify coupon is auto-applied
4. Test removing the coupon
5. Test with a user who has already used the coupon

## Configuration

### Coupon Requirements
The WELCOMETOTA coupon in Strapi should have:
- `code`: "WELCOMETOTA"
- `isActive`: true
- Valid date range (`validFrom` and `validUntil`)
- Proper discount configuration

### User Tracking
The system tracks coupon usage through the `usedByUserData` field in the coupon record, which should contain user information when a coupon is applied.

## Error Handling

- If API calls fail, auto-selection is skipped silently
- Invalid coupon data is handled gracefully
- User can still manually apply coupons if auto-selection fails

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Welcome Coupons**: Extend to support different welcome coupons for different user segments
2. **Usage Analytics**: Track auto-selection success rates
3. **A/B Testing**: Test different auto-selection strategies
4. **Personalization**: Auto-select different coupons based on user behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Coupon not auto-applying**:
   - Check if user is logged in
   - Verify WELCOMETOTA coupon exists and is active in Strapi
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Auto-selection happening for users who already used it**:
   - Verify `usedByUserData` is properly updated when coupons are applied
   - Check user ID matching logic

3. **Styling issues**:
   - Verify CSS classes and inline styles are applied correctly
   - Check for conflicting styles

### Debug Information

The implementation includes console logging for debugging:
- `ðŸŽ« Auto-applying WELCOMETOTA coupon for user: [userId]`
- `âœ… WELCOMETOTA coupon auto-applied successfully`
- Error messages for failed operations

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/coupons?populate=*` - Fetch all coupons with usage data
- `POST /api/coupons/validate` - Validate coupon for specific order amount
- `POST /api/coupons/apply` - Apply coupon and update usage tracking
