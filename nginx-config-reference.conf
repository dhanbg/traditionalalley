# Apply these settings to your production nginx configuration

# In your server block or location block for the API routes:
server {
    # ... other server configuration ...
    
    # Increase client body size to handle large PDF uploads (15MB)
    client_max_body_size 15M;
    
    # Increase buffer sizes for large requests
    client_body_buffer_size 1M;
    client_header_buffer_size 4k;
    large_client_header_buffers 8 16k;
    
    # Timeout settings for large uploads
    client_body_timeout 60s;
    client_header_timeout 60s;
    
    # Specific configuration for API routes
    location /api/ {
        # Proxy settings for Next.js
