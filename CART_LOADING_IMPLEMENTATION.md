# Cart Loading Implementation

This implementation ensures that pages don't load until the cart is fully loaded from the backend, preventing users from seeing incomplete or stale cart data.

## How It Works

### 1. Context State Management
The cart loading state is managed in `context/Context.jsx` with these new state variables:

- `isCartLoading`: Boolean indicating if the cart is currently being loaded from the backend
- `cartLoadedOnce`: Boolean indicating if the cart has been loaded at least once since the user logged in

### 2. Loading Logic
The cart loading process:

1. **Initial State**: When the app starts, `isCartLoading` is set to `true` and `cartLoadedOnce` to `false`
2. **User Detection**: If no user is logged in, both flags are set to indicate loading is complete
3. **Backend Loading**: When a user is present, the cart is loaded from the backend
4. **Completion**: Once loading is complete (success or error), `isCartLoading` is set to `false` and `cartLoadedOnce` to `true`

### 3. CartLoadingGuard Component
The `CartLoadingGuard` component (`components/common/CartLoadingGuard.jsx`) provides:

- **Loading Screen**: Shows a professional loading screen while cart is being loaded
- **Content Protection**: Prevents wrapped content from rendering until cart is loaded
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatically shows content after 10 seconds to prevent infinite loading
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug logging for troubleshooting

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Wrap any component that depends on cart data:

```jsx
import CartLoadingGuard from "@/components/common/CartLoadingGuard";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <CartLoadingGuard>
      <div>
        {/* This content won't show until cart is loaded */}
        <ShoppingCart />
      </div>
    </CartLoadingGuard>
  );
}
```

### With Debug Mode
For development and troubleshooting:

```jsx
<CartLoadingGuard showDebug={true}>
  <MyCartDependentComponent />
</CartLoadingGuard>
```

### Custom Timeout
To change the timeout (default is 10 seconds):

```jsx
<CartLoadingGuard timeout={15000}>
  <MyCartDependentComponent />
</CartLoadingGuard>
```

## Implementation Details

### Pages Protected
Currently implemented on:
- Shopping Cart page (`/shopping-cart`)
- Checkout page (`/checkout`)

### Context Integration
The loading states are available in any component using the context:

```jsx
import { useContextElement } from "@/context/Context";

function MyComponent() {
  const { isCartLoading, cartLoadedOnce } = useContextElement();
  
  if (isCartLoading) {
    return <div>Loading cart...</div>;
  }
  
  // Cart is loaded, safe to use cart data
  return <div>Cart content here</div>;
}
```

### Loading States
- **Guest Users**: No loading required, immediately marked as loaded
- **Logged-in Users**: Loading state active until backend cart data is fetched
- **Error Handling**: Loading state cleared even if backend request fails
- **User Changes**: Loading state resets when user logs in/out

## Testing

Visit `/test-cart-loading` to see the loading states in action and debug information.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Infinite Loading**: Check browser console for debug logs with `showDebug={true}`
2. **Cart Not Loading**: Verify backend API endpoints are accessible
3. **Hydration Issues**: The component waits for mounting to prevent SSR mismatches

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode to see:
- Mount state
- User presence
- Loading flags
- Timeout status

## Future Enhancements

- Add loading progress indicators
- Implement retry logic for failed cart loads
- Add loading state for individual cart operations
- Create loading skeletons for better UX
